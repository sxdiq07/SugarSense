# ðŸ§  SugarSense â€” Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

SugarSense is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on diagnostic health data. Built using Python and Scikit-learn, it applies classic classification algorithms to real-world medical datasets and evaluates their effectiveness in healthcare risk prediction.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project explores how supervised machine learning algorithms can aid in early diabetes detection using patient-level medical data. It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Model training and comparison
- Evaluation metrics
- Final model serialization (`.sav` file)

## ðŸ¤– Modeling Approach

The following models were implemented and compared:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier âœ… (best performer)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

Key techniques:
- Imputation of biologically impossible values (e.g., 0 insulin)
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- 80-20 train-test split
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score


## âœ… Results

Random Forest Classifier showed the best performance with:
- Accuracy: ~81%
- Strong generalization on test data
- Low false negatives (important in healthcare)
